# shortest_path_problem
A python program that allows to create graphs and find the shortest path between two vertices.

In this python program you can create the roads network of a city that follows a rectangle street plan. The city's roads network can be seen as a graph, with the crossroads and roads juctions being the vertices of the graph and the roads being the edges of the graph.
